Advance SQL Project Description

This repository contains code and SQL queries for four different database management system projects, each designed to achieve specific objectives:

## Project 1 : Academic Management System (Using SQL)

### Objective
Design and develop an academic management system using SQL. The system manages student information and course enrollment.

### Steps
1. **Database Creation**
   - Create tables for StudentInfo, CourseInfo, and EnrollmentInfo.
   - Define columns and establish foreign key constraints.

2. **Data Creation**
   - Insert sample data into the tables.

3. **Retrieve Student Information**
   - Write queries to retrieve student details, course lists, and course information.
   - Test the queries for accurate data retrieval.

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Create queries to retrieve enrollment statistics, student lists, instructor counts, and course rankings.

## Project 2: Student Database Management System (PostgreSQL)

### Objective
Design and implement a Student Database Management System efficiently.

### Tasks
1. **Database Setup**
   - Create a database named "student_database."
   - Create a table called "student_table" with various student information columns.

2. **Data Entry**
   - Insert 10 sample records into the "student_table."

3. **Student Information Retrieval**
   - Develop queries to retrieve student details, including student name, contact information, and enrollment status.
   - Retrieve lists of courses in which specific students are enrolled.
   - Retrieve course information, including course names and instructor information.
   - Test the queries to ensure accurate retrieval of student information.

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Write queries to retrieve the number of students enrolled in each course.
   - Retrieve lists of students enrolled in specific courses.
   - Retrieve counts of enrolled students for each instructor.
   - Retrieve lists of students who are enrolled in multiple courses.
   - Retrieve courses with the highest number of enrolled students.

## Project 3: Event Management System (PostgreSQL)

### Objective
Develop an application for creating and managing events, tracking attendees, and handling registrations efficiently.

### Tasks
1. **Database Creation**
   - Create a database named "EventsManagement."
   - Create tables for Events, Attendees, and Registrations.

2. **Data Creation**
   - Insert sample data into the tables for Events, Attendees, and Registrations.

3. **Manage Event Details**
   - Implement operations for inserting, updating, and deleting events.

4. **Manage Track Attendees and Handle Events**
   - Create operations for inserting new attendees and registering attendees for events.

5. **Develop Queries**
   - Write queries to retrieve information, generate attendee lists, and calculate event attendance statistics.

## Project 4: OLAP Operations (PostgreSQL)

### Objective
Perform OLAP operations on the "sales_sample" table to analyze sales data from different dimensions and perspectives.

### Tasks
1. **Database Creation**
   - Create a database to store sales data.
   - Create a table named "sales_sample" with specified columns.

2. **Data Creation**
   - Insert 10 sample records into the "sales_sample" table, representing sales data.

3. **Perform OLAP Operations**
   - Implement OLAP operations such as Drill Down, Rollup, Cube, Slice, and Dice to analyze sales data.
